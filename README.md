# Godot JSBSim Module

## Introduction

I needed a high quality FDM attched to a game engine, without all the
usual game fluff and trappings.

Godot is open source, and JSBSim is open source. The rest is history

## Building

* Make sure to clone with submodules
* Build JSBSim
```script
cd jsbsim
cmake .
make
```
* Build this
```script
scons
```
